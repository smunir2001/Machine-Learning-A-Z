# Data Preprocessing
1. Importing the libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Taking care of missing data
4. Encoding categorical data
    * independent variable
    * dependent variable
5. Splitting the dataset into the training set & the test set
6. Feature scaling

### Libraries
* numpy
allows us to work with arrays
* matplotlib
allows us to plot charts & graphs
* pandas
allows us to import datasets but also create matrix of features and dependent vector

Features are also known as independent variables.
